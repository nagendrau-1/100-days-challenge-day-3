100 Days of Hacking – Day 3
Objective
To understand how WHOIS lookups are used as an initial step in OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) investigations, especially when analyzing suspicious or scam websites.
  Academy : SKILLSUPRISE
    Mentor : Manoj kumar Koravangi
Scenario
A website claiming to be a crypto investment platform was promoting unrealistic returns, which raised immediate red flags.
Instead of guessing or jumping to conclusions, I performed a WHOIS lookup to gather verifiable information about the domain.
Methodology
Using WHOIS, I collected the following details:
•	Domain registrar
•	Hosting provider
•	Domain registration date
•	Domain expiry date
•	Public contact information
This information helps establish domain legitimacy and identify patterns linked to malicious activity.
Key Learnings
•	WHOIS is a starting point for OSINT investigations
•	Newly registered domains are often associated with scams
•	Registrar and hosting details can help link multiple scam websites
•	WHOIS data supports digital evidence preservation
•	Simple reconnaissance can uncover valuable intelligence
Tools Used
•	whois (CLI / online WHOIS services)
•	Web browser
•	OSINT mindset
